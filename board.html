            <h2>The heart of ZammitCorp</h2>
            <p>From left to right, Julien Semaan (Chief Consultant Officer), Ludovic Zammit (Chief Executive Officer) and Derek Wuelfrath (Chief Operationnal Officer) during a monthly board meeting at the fabulous Burger King on Cremazie and Saint-Laurent in Montreal.</p>
          </div>
          <p>These three form the heart of ZammitCorp and nothing would be possible without them. From managing the IT infrastructure to engaging in consulting activities as well as making Turkey Sandwiches, nothing is done without one of these men approving the job. That's just how cool they are.</p>

            <h2>The Chinese cousin of Zaym</h2>
            <p>The Chief Agricultural Officer of ZammitCorp in an important chat with the plants delivery company.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Clearly the most central piece of the board when looking at the members of the Zammit Family. Zaym's chinese cousin (which name must stay confidential) has joined ZammitCorp right after it aquired a Parc-Extension parking in which he was growing plants.</p>

            <h2>The cousins from Turkey</h2>
            <p>At first hand, this may look like two arab guys playing cards in the desert, but this was a critical meeting of the Middle-East board when in 2014, ZammitCorp expanded his empire by buying 45% of the clothing manufacturers in Turkey.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Like Zaym's chinese cousin, their names cannot be shown publicly.</p>

            <p>The greatest piano artist as well as Zaym's most look-alike cousin.</p>
          </div>
          <p>He deserves to be known even more than he is now. Make sure you visit his great web 4.0 website designed by the web division of ZammitCorp (<a href="http://www.zamm.it">http://www.zamm.it</a>)</p>
